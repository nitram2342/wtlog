This is Nitram's archaic work time logging tool. I use it for several years.
It is far from being perfect. I think it is useful, because it is as simple
as possible.

There is a text file for every date. The text file format is shown below.
It can be used for multiple customers and multiple projects.

Usage:
--------------------

$ wtlog.pl
wtlog.pl <customer> [start | stop | edit | pause | info | list | timereport]


$ wtlog.pl cust1 start
Current state    : working
Sum of work time : 0 s
Sum of breaks    : 0 s
Netto work time  : 0 s


$ wtlog.pl cust1 pause
Current state    : pause
Sum of work time : 23 m
Sum of breaks    : 0 s
Netto work time  : 23 m


$ wtlog.pl cust1 pause
Current state    : working
Sum of work time : 28 m
Sum of breaks    : 5 m
Netto work time  : 23 m


$ wtlog.pl cust1 edit
[raises an editor]


$ wtlog.pl cust1 stop
[...]


Time report:
--------------------

You can generate work time reports with wtlog. Wtlog uses a latex template and renders
the invoice logs into this template.

$ wtlog.pl cust1 timereport 2011-03-01 2011-04-01
[...]

(The second date of the date range is not included in the list.)


File format:
--------------------

Files are placed unter ~/.wtlog/ and are named in the format of ISO date,
underscore, customer short name and file suffix '.dat', e.g. 
"2011-03-30_cust1.dat". An example content is given below:


state: finished
work_time: 2011-03-30 09:52:06 to 2011-03-30 17:59:20
== Invoice logs ==

- video codec testing (youtube)
- on-the-job training (dilbert, xkcd, ...)
== Personal logs ==

Personal logs are kept private, while invoice logs are written to the time
report. Personal logs can be used to remember things, like phone call conversations.
